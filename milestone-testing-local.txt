This document explains how to run local milestone testing. 
We provide a couple convenience endpoints for you to do this:

You may want to make an `outputs` and `test_data` directory
to hold client outputs / diffs, and base generated test data respectively.
The following command does that for you (assuming you are running this in your base project directory,
and have these two folders existing there in relative locations already):
`make startcontainer outputdir=$(pwd)/outputs testdir=$(pwd)/test_data`

`make run_mile mile_id=1 testdir=$(pwd)/test_data outputdir=$(pwd)/outputs`
Would be the corresponding command that runs milestone number 1. Each milestone (except the 5th and last) contains 10 tests.
You can see the Make target `run_mile` and the corresponding script it calls, that is kept in infra_scripts/, to further
understand how the test battery for each milestone is structured under the hood.

There is a sub target called `run_test` which can be run similarly, but just for one test (e.g. test 02)
`make run_test test_id=02 testdir=$(pwd)/test_data outputdir=$(pwd)/outputs`

You may want to use these for convenience, but manually trigger your client/server when you do specific debugging,
hopping into your docker container.

Remember you can `docker attach` to your container to run client/server commands directly inside.
